= Introduction =
Import Export WooCommerce Order Data from/to Shipping Carriers Site/Tools and Easily Print Shipping Labels for USPS (United State Postal Service) using Stamps.com, UPS using UPS Worldship, Endicia and FedEx.

The Order XML File Export Import Plugin for WooCommerce will export your WooCommerce orders in XML format. This XML format is supported by Stamps.com desktop application, UPS WorldShip, Endicia and FedEx. Our plugin will help to eliminate those manual efforts while transferring your WooCommerce store orders for printing the label while fulfilling the orders.

The exported XML can be easily imported to the Service Providers tools. After generating labels from Service Providers tools, you can import the order data ( like tracking number , postage cost ) as XML to your WooCommerce site. It is super simple!

<ul>
<li>Export Orders  into a XML file supported by Stamps.com, UPS WorldShip, Endicia and FedEx.</li>

<li>After import, Create Shipping Labels through Shipping Carriers Site/Tools.</li>
<li>Import the order data like Tracking Number back to Your WooCommerce Site.</li>

Into the exported XML of Stamps.com, we are used "http://stamps.com/xml/namespace/2009/8/Client/BatchProcessingV1" this as xmlns attribute to define the namespace of the XML. 
Similarly, in FedEx and UPS we are used, "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance".
